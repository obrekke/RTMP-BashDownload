# RTMP Bash Download

A tiny bash script for downloading a RTMP file with VLC.
_I made this to download videos from my school's system to be able to pause and rewind._
_It is a work in progress._

**How To:**	
1. Replace the stream variable with the rtmp link to download, but remember the quotes! That was my first bug. 
=2. Replace the output variable with the path to your preferred location and a file name. For example: ` C:\path\to\my\Desktop\THIS_IS_MY_VIDEO.mp4 `
3. Keep the original .mp4 extension for both files (original and to download)
